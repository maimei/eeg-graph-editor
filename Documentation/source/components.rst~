The GraphEditor consists of three different modules:

 * view
 * graph
 * model

.. _the-view:

The View
--------

The view module represents the GraphEditor GUI and contains all components (buttons, textlines, spinboxes etc.) that are needed to execute certain actions.

.. _the-graph:

The Graph
---------

The graph module contains the class :class:`CorrelGraph` that is able to visualize an eeg graph and a phase shift graph. To distinguish between those two graphs the edges are colored differently.

The class CorrelGraph covers all the necessary functions to paint the graph or to get certain information about it. 

.. _the-model:

The Model
---------

The model module is the mediator between the view and the graph. It contains all functions to tell every view element what to do when a certain action is executed by the user. 

It leads this signal to the graph module, where the logic is realized.
So in order to launch the GraphEditor run the model module.
