The GraphEditor consists of three different modules:

 * view
 * graph
 * model

.. _the-view:

The View
========

The view module contains all the components (buttons, textlines, spinboxes etc.) that are needed to 
execute certain actions.

.. _the-graph:

The Graph
========

The graph module contains two classes:

 * The EEG graph class
 * The PS (phaseshift) graph class

Both these classes cover all the necessary functions to paint the graph or to get certain information about it. 

.. _the-model:

The Model
=========

The model module is the mediator between the view and the graph. It contains all functions to tell every view element what to do when a certain action is executed by the user. It leads this signal to graph module where the logic is realized.
So in order to launch the GraphEditor run the model module.
